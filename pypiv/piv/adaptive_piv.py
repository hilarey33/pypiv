class AdaptivePIV(DirectPIV):
    """
    Class for the adaptive piv.

    After the initial piv is done an adaptive piv can be performed to minimize the error or to make the grid finer.
    Therefore the correlation function is inherited as well as the GridSpec.
    In addition to the inherited grid a new Grid is calculated by deforming the grid with respect to the prior calculated velocities.
    In the case that the new grid is supposed to be finer then the one before, the velocities need to be upscaled.
